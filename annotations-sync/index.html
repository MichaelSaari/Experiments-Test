        <h1>3D Canine Anatomy: Portosystemic Shunt (PSS)</h1>
        <img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="assets/CT Scan 2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
                What is a liver shunt? 
                <br>
                <br>
                The portal vein is a large vein that collects blood from the gastrointestinal system, pancreas, and spleen and carries it into the liver, where toxins and other byproducts are removed. 
                A liver shunt occurs when an abnormal connection persists or forms between the portal vein or one of its branches, and another vein, allowing blood to bypass, or shunt, around the liver.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the majority of cases, a liver shunt is caused by a birth defect called a congenital portosystemic shunt. In some cases, multiple small shunts form because of severe liver disease such as cirrhosis. 
                These are referred to as acquired portosystemic shunts.

        <h1>Porto Systemic Shunt (PSS)</h1>
        <img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="assets/congenital portosystemic shunt.jpg" alt="">
        <p>

                A congenital portosystemic shunt develops if:
                <br>
                <br>
                The ductus venosus fails to collapse at birth and remains intact and open after the fetus no longer needs it. A blood vessel outside the liver develops abnormally and remains open after the ductus venosus closes.

        <h1>Caudal Vena Cava</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
                The Caudal Vena Cava is an unpaired vessel, 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter and 8 to 12 cm long. 
                It lies in the cranial mediastinum ventral to the trachea and is in contact with the esophagus on its left side. 
                It is also in contact with the thymus when this gland is fully developed. 
                It runs through the cranial mediastinum and is the most ventral of the several structures that course through the thoracic inlet. 
                It is formed, at a level just cranial to the thoracic inlet, by the convergence of the right and left brachiocephalic veins. 
                These form an angle, open cranially, of approximately 90 degrees, so that each vein enters the cranial vena cava at an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the median plane. 
                The cranial vena cava empties into the cranial part of the right atrium. Some mammals, such as the rabbit, retain the embryonic pattern of paired cranial venae cavae draining into the sinus venarum of the right atrium. 
                As would be expected, this condition (see Fig. 12-3) is often seen as an anomaly in other animals, including the dog (Fig. 12-3). Cox et al. (1991) describe an example in a horse and make reference to reports in the dog.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The main artery from the heart is called the aorta. It is large, and has a thick wall because of the high pressure of blood that is flowing through it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The ascending aorta supplies the head with blood through arteries called the brachiocephalic trunk, eventually branching to the carotid arteries.

        <h1>Descending Aorta</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The descending aorta goes through the thoracic cavity and supplies the rest of the body from within the abdomen. A branch of the descending artery, called the coronary artery, supplies the heart. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Letâ€™s not forget the fact that the heart is an organ with millions of cells also, and they need oxygen and nutrients also if they are to perform their job.
